# 5-DOF-Robotic-Arm-Object-Detection 
(Source Files to be added soon)
A system to detect the position of an object and how it is oriented through geometry equations to drive a 5 DOF robotic arm. With only laser beams and photo resistors, the system is able to analyze the 2D shadow created by the object that falls in the detection zone of the laser beams then detect where the object is located and how it is tilted.
